1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?


If a function attempts to modify something outside of its scope, then this is a side effect (more specifically a memory leak). Side effects can be prevented by surrounding the code in a useEffect hook. Putting an empty array at the end tells it to render once. Or specifying a specific array will cause it to only render on that individual element.
